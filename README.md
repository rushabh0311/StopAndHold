# StopAndHold
StopAndHold is a Python-based tool developed to detect and analyze stable "stop" and "hold" states in automotive sensor signals. It identifies key timing points, visualizes cycles, and exports results to help improve system diagnostics and performance.

## 🎯 Objective

To detect and analyze the specific intervals where a mechanical or electronic component:
- **Stops (i.e., reaches and maintains a stable position)**
- **Holds (i.e., stays within a defined value range over time)**

---

## ⚙️ Features

- 📉 Real-time data plotting from sensor input logs (CSV/Excel)
- 🕒 Detection of "stable hold" periods based on custom thresholds
- 📊 Visualization of key timing intervals (e.g., hold duration, transition points)
- ⚙️ Configurable tolerance settings for flexible signal analysis
- 📁 Export of analysis reports and visualizations

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas / NumPy** – Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – Signal plotting
- **SciPy** – Signal processing (if applicable)
